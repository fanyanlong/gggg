Scripts should be called in the same directory as where the .git and .gitmodules files lie. Otherwise the scripts might incorrectly assume that there are not submodules.
Scripts are slow.
Scripts of master branch do not work on OS X, this because xargs there does not allow for an -r argument (use no xargs-branch).
When invoking git rcommit without giving the message, the shell somehow breaks afterwards and has to be restarted.
The scripts work fine for git versions 1.7.6.1, 1.7.7.3 and 1.7.10.1, but there are some known problems with 1.7.8.4 and 1.7.9.4.
